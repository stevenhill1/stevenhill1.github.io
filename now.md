I am currently living and working at home in North Wiltshire.

In my role as Director of Research for [Research England](https://re.ukri.org/), I am focussing on:

* how to allocate additional funding streams (for specialist institutions, announced in [Budget 2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/budget-2020-documents/budget-2020), and capital funding, [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-fires-up-rd-across-the-country-to-cement-the-uk-as-science-superpower) on 1 July 2020)
* working on Research England's contributions to the [Spending Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-launches-comprehensive-spending-review)
* our upcoming call (joint with the [Office for Students]()) on [reducing inequalities in postgraduate research study](http://re.ukri.org/news-opinions-events/news/notice-of-a-joint-research-england-and-office-for-students-funding-competition-to-reduce-inequalities-in-postgraduate-research-study/)
* the future work plan and projects of the [Forum for Responsible Research Metrics](https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/research-policy/open-science/Pages/forum-for-responsible-research-metrics.aspx)


I am thinking about, researching, or drafting articles on:

* alternatives to peer review for the allocation of research funding (mentioned in a [previous post](https://stevenhill.org.uk/a-post-pandemic-research-agenda/))
* the implications of applying the ideas of systems thinking to the research system (also mentioned in a [the same post](https://stevenhill.org.uk/a-post-pandemic-research-agenda/))
* updating the ideas in my post on ['Four trends shaping the future of research evaluation'](https://stevenhill.org.uk/four-trends-shaping-the-future-of-research-evaluation/) in the light of the pandemic
* the role of 'realist' approach to evaluation in research policy

I am currently reading:

* Scale: The Universal Laws of Life and Death in Organisms, Cities and Companies by Geoffrey West [Amazon UK link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Scale-Universal-Organisms-Cities-Companies-ebook/dp/B010P7Z8J0/)
* The Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu [Amazon UK link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu-ebook/dp/B00S8FCJCQ/)
