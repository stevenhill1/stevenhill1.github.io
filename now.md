I am currently living and working at home in North Wiltshire.

In my role as Director of Research for [Research England](https://re.ukri.org/), I am focussing on:

* planning work on the future UK national research assessment following the [speech](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/science-minister-on-the-research-landscape) by Amanda Solloway
* the future work plan and projects of the [Forum for Responsible Research Metrics](https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/research-policy/open-science/Pages/forum-for-responsible-research-metrics.aspx)


I am thinking about, researching, or drafting articles on:

* alternatives to peer review for the allocation of research funding (mentioned in a [previous post](https://stevenhill.org.uk/a-post-pandemic-research-agenda/))
* the implications of applying the ideas of systems thinking to the research system (also mentioned in a [the same post](https://stevenhill.org.uk/a-post-pandemic-research-agenda/))
* updating the ideas in my post on ['Four trends shaping the future of research evaluation'](https://stevenhill.org.uk/four-trends-shaping-the-future-of-research-evaluation/) in the light of the pandemic
* the role of 'realist' approach to evaluation in research policy

I am currently reading:

* Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg Mckeown [Amazon UK link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown-ebook/dp/B00HELB6XI/)
* The Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu [Amazon UK link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu-ebook/dp/B00S8FCJCQ/)
