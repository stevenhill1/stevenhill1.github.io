Should open scholarship measures be incorporated into assessment and incentive systems for researchers? This question is addressed in a recent [blog post](https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2018/08/21/measuring-openness-should-we-be-careful-what-we-wish-for/) by [Lizzie Gadd](https://twitter.com/lizziegadd?). In the thoughtful post, Lizzie challenges the idea that that measurement-led incentive structures are necessarily a positive development in the progress towards more openness, and issues about measurement and the place of assessment in the research environment are surfaced that extend beyond openness _per se_.

It is important to distinguish between the different ways in which measurement can be used, and the related question of at what level the measurement is conducted. Being able to measure how open research is, at least at the level of national systems or disciplines is necessary to know whether interventions (or even lack of interventions) are working. The well-used slogan 'you don't fatten a pig by weighing it' may well be true, but it is equally true that you don't know how effective your pig food is if you don't weigh the pig...

If measurement is made at more granular levels than national systems, looking, for example, at the openness of research at an institutional or individual researcher level, as well as being able to measure progress, there is the potential to create incentives. It is this use of measurement, I think, that concerns Lizzie.

One of the concerns raised in the post is the danger of conflating research openness and research quality. I tend to agree that some of the bland statement about open research being good research can be a little over simplistic, but part of the problem here is that descriptions of 'quality research' is itself over simplistic. There is not one linear scale of research quality, but many dimensions of quality. What matters, and how those dimensions are weighted to make relative judgements, depends not only on the purpose of the judgement, but also on the perspective of the judge. I have [written](https://stevenhill.org.uk/dimensions-of-quality-research/) about this before, and in the context of a multi-dimensional view of research quality, I can see no problem with openness being one of those dimensions.
