On the [HEFCE blog](http://blog.hefce.ac.uk/), Kate Turton, from my team, has an [interesting overview](http://blog.hefce.ac.uk/2016/08/30/what-does-excellence-mean-in-postgraduate-education/) of a recent [conference](http://www.ukcge.ac.uk/events/ac16-93.aspx) on excellence in postgraduate education:

>"Closely linked with teaching is the supervision of masters and PhD students as they develop their research skills. [...] Supervision is a subjective experience and the relationship between academic and student is fundamental. The vast majority of respondents to the [Postgraduate Research Experience Survey (PRES)](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resource/postgraduate-research-experience-survey-2015) rate their supervision as high quality and agree that their supervisor had the skills and subject knowledge to support their research."
