This is a bit late again, as a result of a busy weekend. This week I have:

  * Discussed with colleagues further work we might do concerning postgraduate research policy following the [recent](http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/year/2013/201313/#d.en.82612) [analysis](http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/year/2013/201314/#d.en.82615) published by HEFCE
  * Reviewed the near final version of HEFCE's consulation on open access which will be launched soon
  * Published blog posts on [public good innovation](http://stevenhill.org.uk/public-good-innovation-and-the-free-market/) and [open data](http://stevenhill.org.uk/on-data-management-and-open-research/)
  * Attended a [1994 Group](http://www.1994group.co.uk/) policy forum on research impact
  * Listened to fascinating talks by [David Phipps](https://twitter.com/mobilemobilizer) and [Gary Myers](https://twitter.com/KMbeing) from [York University, Toronto](http://www.yorku.com/web/index.htm) about their work on knowledge mobilisation
  * Enjoyed some epic stages in this year's [Tour de France](http://www.letour.fr/le-tour/2013/us/)
  * Experienced the [First Night of the Proms](http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/whats-on/2013/july-12/14554) at a very hot [Royal Albert Hall](http://www.royalalberthall.com/)
  * Watched excellent productions of [Othello](http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/othello) and [Children of the Sun](http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/children-of-the-sun) at the wonderfully air-conditioned [National Theatre](http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/)
