It&#8217;s been quiet here for a while. It could be that I have been busy. I am about to transition into a new work role, so the last few weeks I have been finishing things off, and now I will have lots of new things to learn.

But I don&#8217;t think the lack of content is related to that. I have started quite a few draft posts over the last few weeks that have not yet seen the light of day. No, I think the problem is that I worry too much about things being perfect, my version of what [Steven Pressfield](http://www.stevenpressfield.com/) calls, in his book &#8216;[The War of Art](http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/)&#8216;, the Resistance (with a deliberate capital &#8216;R&#8217;).

So, I am going to make some changes. I will aim for more short posts, and not worry whether everything is perfect and all my arguments watertight. And I will write on a wider variety of topics, not just research policy.
