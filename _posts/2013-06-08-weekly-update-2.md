This week I have:

  * Enjoyed an excellent <a href="http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/theatre/whats-on/globe-theatre/the-tempest-2013" target="_self" title="">production of The Tempest</a> at the Globe Theatre.
  * Continued working on HEFCE's open access consultation plans
  * Finished preparing for a talk at the ARMA conference next week
  * Spent a day 'off site' with my team planning our future work
  * Thought about the possible work we need to do on research postgraduate policy and funding
