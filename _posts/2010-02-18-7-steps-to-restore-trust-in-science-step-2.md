  1. <span style="color:#c0c0c0;">Communicate about the process of science as well as the content</span> [[previous post](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-step-1/)]
  2. **Make research outputs available to all for free**. The cost of access to the scientific literature is barrier for many to engage directly with research, and this has the effect of making science appear as a closed world. People outside of the research community, even those that have a strong education in science, are not able to make their own judgements about controversial subjects, but have to rely on secondary sources. The publishing model for science is from the age of [Gutenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg), but we are in the age of [Berners-Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berners-Lee). Of course the costs of publishing scientific research need to be paid for, but surely there is a better business model than &#8216;pay to access&#8217;, especially now that the costs of delivery (in electronic format) are so low?
  3. <span style="color:#c0c0c0;">Publish negative results and unsuccessful experiments too</span>
  4. <span style="color:#c0c0c0;">Publish peer review comments with research outputs</span>
  5. <span style="color:#c0c0c0;">Attach a summary for non-experts to research outputs</span>
  6. <span style="color:#c0c0c0;">Make raw data available as early as possible</span>
  7. <span style="color:#c0c0c0;">Use new technology to open research conferences to all</span>
