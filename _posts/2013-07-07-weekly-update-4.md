Once again only getting round to this after two weeks &#8211; maybe I should retitle as a 'fortnightly' update! Anyway, over the last two weeks I have:

  * Worked on the forward plan for my team
  * Heard about the work of the [HE International Unit](http://www.international.ac.uk/)
  * Caught up [Jisc](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/) colleagues, specifically on their work to support institutional repositories
  * Discussed the subtleties of HEFCE's [funding allocation](http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/rsrch/howfundr/mainstreamqr/) mechanism with [BIS](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-innovation-skills) colleagues
  * Attended the [Science and Innovation Conference](http://scienceinnovation-conference.co.uk/)
  * Taken part in a fascinating [workshop](https://damaro-dmponline2013.eventbrite.co.uk/)on Oxford University's [project](http://damaro.oucs.ox.ac.uk/) on research data management
  * Attended my first meeting of the [Open Access Implementation Group](http://open-access.org.uk/). We talked about embargo periods, open access monograph publishing and the future of the group.
  * Represented HEFCE at the management group for the [National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement](http://www.publicengagement.ac.uk/)
  * Talked to colleagues at the [British Library](http://www.bl.uk/) about their interactions with the Higher Education Sector
  * Met the Chief Executive of [UKRIO](http://www.ukrio.org/)
  * Caught up with some of my previous colleagues at [Research Councils UK](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk)
