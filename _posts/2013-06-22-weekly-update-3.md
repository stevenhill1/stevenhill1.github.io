The last two weeks have been quite hectic, so much so that I missed last weeks weekly update. In the last two weeks I have:

  * Spoken in one of the plenary sessions at the <a href="https://www.arma.ac.uk/events/annual-conference/arma-2013" target="_self" title="">ARMA conference</a>. I talked about the future landscape for research policy, and got some really useful insights from the audience in the Q&A. I intend to blog about some of this in the coming weeks.
  * Attended an interesting <a href="http://www.lssi.leeds.ac.uk/events/open-access-publishing-in-the-social-sciences/" target="_self" title="">panel discussion</a> in Leeds University on open access in the social sciences.
  * Caught up on the <a href="http://www.esrc.ac.uk/funding-and-guidance/funding-opportunities/26526/administrative-data-research-centre-4-july.aspx" target="_self" title="">plans</a> the ESRC have for facilitating access to administrative data for social science research.
  * Discussed the policy implications of the excellent <a href="http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/" target="_self" title="">Nuffield Council on Bioethics</a> report on <a href="http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/emerging-biotechnologies" target="_self" title="">Emerging Biotechnologies</a>
  * Reflected on how often I should aim to post on this blog, and then hardly posted at all because of competing time pressures&#8230;
  * Went to see <a href="http://www.thehothousewestend.com/index-hothouse.php" target="_self" title="">The Hothouse</a>, a strange and disturbing play by Harold Pinter. Great performances from Simon Russell Beale and John Simm.
  * Contributed to the first meeting of a working group, convened by the <a href="http://www.researchinfonet.org/finch/" target="_self" title="">Research Information Network</a>, that will be developing a framework for monitoring the progress towards open access.
  * Attended my first meeting of HEFCE's Research and Knowledge Exchange <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/about/staff/committees/" target="_self" title="">strategic advisory committee</a>. Interesting discussions of Industrial Strategy, the <a href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/Universities-and-business-to-build-local-growth-opportunities-68a92.aspx" target="_self" title="">Witty review</a>, the value of HEFCE's research funding, and the international context of research.
  * Worked on my team's forward plan, following our planning day earlier this month
  * Admired the <a href="http://twitter.com/stevenhill/status/347438250719313920/photo/1" target="_self" title="">display</a> of poppies in the fields around where I live.
  * Been bemused by the Govenment's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/rt-hon-owen-paterson-mp-speech-to-rothamsted-research" target="_self" title="">approach</a> to restarting the debate about GM crops. I have a blog post coming on this, but in the meantime I strongly recommend posts by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/political-science/2013/jun/21/genetics-agriculture" target="_self" title="">Paul Nightingale</a> and <a href="http://www.matterforall.org/blog/2013/06/04/ok-now-im-mad-about-gm-get-your-act-together-to-give-us-better-quality-info-someone/" target="_self" title="">Hilary Sutcliffe</a>.
