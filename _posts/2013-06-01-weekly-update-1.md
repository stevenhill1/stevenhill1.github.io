_This is a new venture &#8211; just a quick note of what I have been up to this week. Some weeks are more interesting than others&#8230; I got the idea to do this from reading [Doug Belshaw&#8217;s blog](http://dougbelshaw.com/blog) and his [weeknotes](http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/category/weeknotes/)._

This week I&#8217;ve been:

  * Enjoying a relaxing (and sunny!) bank holiday weekend in the Essex and Suffolk countryside
  * <span style="line-height: 16px;">Working with colleagues on the consultation HEFCE will be launching later in the year on open access</span>
  * Preparing for a presentation that I am giving at the [ARMA conference](https://www.arma.ac.uk/events/annual-conference/arma-2013) on 11 June
  * Met with [Janet Ilieva](https://twitter.com/JanetIlieva), the new head of the [HEFCE Observatory](http://www.hefce.ac.uk/news/newsarchive/2013/name,78928,en.html)
  * Working with colleagues to plan the evidence that HEFCE will submit to the House of Lords [inquiry on scientific infrastructure](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/science-and-technology-committee/news/scientific-infrastructure-inquiry-launch/)
  * Written several blog posts here, and also worked on a guest post on open data that I am writing for [Sciencewise](http://www.sciencewise-erc.org.uk/)
