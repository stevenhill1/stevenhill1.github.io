  1. <span style="color:#888888;">Communicate about the process of science as well as the content</span> [[previous post](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-step-1/)]
  2. <span style="color:#888888;">Make research outputs available to all for free</span> [[previous post](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/02/18/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-%e2%80%93-step-2/)]
  3. <span style="font-weight:bold;" class="Apple-style-span">Publish negative results and unsuccessful experiments too.</span>&nbsp;Sherlock Holmes knew that [dogs that don&#8217;t bark can be as important as those that do](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Blaze). Science progresses as much through negative results as through positive, but it can be hard to get negative results published. This means that those outside of science are only able to see part of the picture. And it can also lead to duplication of effort by scientists themselves, testing ideas that have already been shown to be false.
  4. <span style="color:#888888;">Publish peer review comments with research outputs</span>
  5. <span style="color:#888888;">Attach a summary for non-experts to research outputs</span>
  6. <span style="color:#888888;">Make raw data available as early as possible</span>
  7. <span style="color:#888888;">Use new technology to open research conferences to all</span>
