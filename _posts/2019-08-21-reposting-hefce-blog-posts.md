When the Higher Education Funding Council for England ceased to exist last year its website was [archived](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20180405114956/http://www.hefce.ac.uk/), in line with normal practice. All the content is preserved, but it can be a bit tricky to find things, including the posts that I wrote for the HEFCE blog.

As a result I am going to repost on this site the content that I authored (apart from [this, clearly time-limited post](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20180405120725/http://blog.hefce.ac.uk/2017/12/07/international-panel-ref-2021/)). Starting tomorrow, the posts will appear weekly. Having re-read the posts, some of it at least still feels quite current.
