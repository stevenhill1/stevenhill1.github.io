  1. <span style="color:#888888;">Communicate about the process of science as well as the content [</span>[<span style="color:#888888;">previous post</span>](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-step-1/)<span style="color:#888888;">]</span>
  2. <span style="color:#888888;">Make research outputs available to all for free [</span>[<span style="color:#888888;">previous post</span>](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/02/18/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-%e2%80%93-step-2/)<span style="color:#888888;">]</span>
  3. <span style="color:#888888;">Publish negative results and unsuccessful experiments too [</span>[<span style="color:#888888;">previous post</span>](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-%e2%80%93-step-3/)<span style="color:#888888;">]</span>
  4. <span style="color:#888888;">Publish peer review comments with research outputs. [</span>[<span style="color:#888888;">previous post</span>](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-%e2%80%93-step-4/)<span style="color:#888888;">]</span>
  5. **Attach a summary for non-experts to research outputs.** Science is becoming more and more specialised, so even scientists in related disciplines can find it challenging understand work that isn&#8217;t directly in their field. The challenges that people without a scientific background face are even greater, so scientific research appears remote. If every piece of research had a short clear summary written in non-technical language it would help everyone be clear about its implications.
  6. <span style="color:#888888;">Make raw data available as early as possible</span>
  7. <span style="color:#888888;">Use new technology to open research conferences to all</span>
