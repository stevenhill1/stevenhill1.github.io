  1. <span style="color:#888888;">Communicate about the process of science as well as the content</span> [[previous post](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-step-1/)]
  2. <span style="color:#888888;">Make research outputs available to all for free</span> [[previous post](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/02/18/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-%e2%80%93-step-2/)]
  3. <span style="color:#888888;">Publish negative results and unsuccessful experiments too</span> [[previous post](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-%e2%80%93-step-3/)]
  4. **Publish peer review comments with research outputs.** Peer review is a central process in science for maintaining quality. Peer review takes many forms, both formal and informal, but a key stage is the peer review of scientific outputs. But this process is not transparent, even to those within the subject. Often the anonymous peer reviewers make a major contribution to the content of papers adding extra weight to the robustness of the findings. This could be made more apparent if peer review comments were published, and it was made clear how the paper evolved in response to those comments.
  5. <span style="color:#888888;">Attach a summary for non-experts to research outputs</span>
  6. <span style="color:#888888;">Make raw data available as early as possible</span>
  7. <span style="color:#888888;">Use new technology to open research conferences to all</span>
