  1. <span style="color:#888888;">Communicate about the process of science as well as the content [</span>[<span style="color:#888888;">previous post</span>](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-step-1/)<span style="color:#888888;">]</span>
  2. <span style="color:#888888;">Make research outputs available to all for free [</span>[<span style="color:#888888;">previous post</span>](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/02/18/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-%e2%80%93-step-2/)<span style="color:#888888;">]</span>
  3. <span style="color:#888888;">Publish negative results and unsuccessful experiments too [</span>[<span style="color:#888888;">previous post</span>](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-%e2%80%93-step-3/)<span style="color:#888888;">]</span>
  4. <span style="color:#888888;">Publish peer review comments with research outputs. [</span>[<span style="color:#888888;">previous post</span>](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-%e2%80%93-step-4/)<span style="color:#888888;">]</span>
  5. <span style="color:#888888;">Attach a summary for non-experts to research outputs. [</span>[<span style="color:#888888;">previous post</span>](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/03/12/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-%e2%80%93-step-5/)<span style="color:#888888;">]</span>
  6. <span style="color:#888888;">Make raw data available as early as possible. [</span>[<span style="color:#888888;">previous post</span>](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/03/15/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-%e2%80%93-step-6/)<span style="color:#888888;">]</span>
  7. **Use new technology to open research conferences to all.** Research conferences play an important role in the development of science. Initial finding are presented, ideas discussed and new insights generated.  But access is restricted to those that can afford to travel to the conference and pay to register, making conferences appear closed. Technology makes is so easy to make research conferences more open, and at the simplest level all organisers need to do is publish a <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> hash-tag. The participants then do the rest. Or why not make audio recordings available online together with slide presentations? With the help of a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Flip-Video-Camcorder-Generation-Memory/dp/B0029U298U/ref=sr_1_1/277-5647932-6796341?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1268590676&sr=8-1" target="_blank">cheap video camera</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, a video record can be published. Live streaming is a slightly more complicated option.  In the face of all these choices some conferences organisers are trying to [close down](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2009/07/02/new-media-and-science-journalism/) rather than open up, but surely more openness can only help us all to engage with the research that matters. After all, science has nothing to hide.
