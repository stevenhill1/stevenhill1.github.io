Another two week gap… Since my last update I have:

  * talked about open access at the [Publishers Association](http://www.publishers.org.uk/)
  * heard [Renée Fleming](http://www.reneefleming.com/) sing the countess in [Richard Straus's Capriccio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capriccio_(opera)) at the [Royal Opera House](http://www.roh.org.uk/events/f8nt4). Sublime
  * attended a dinner at the [Royal Society of Chemistry](http://www.rsc.org/) to discuss open data in the chemical sciences. I have a blog post coming on this
  * met with BIS colleagues to talk about evidence of research impact
  * caught up with [Laura Dawson](https://mobile.twitter.com/lauradobbo) and others at the [Royal Society science policy centre](http://royalsociety.org/policy/)
  * discussed areas of mutual interest with [Chris Hale](https://mobile.twitter.com/chrishaleuk) and others at [Universities UK](http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx)
  * helped finalise the HEFCE [consultation](http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/year/2013/201316/#d.en.82765) on open access, and published a [blog post](http://stevenhill.org.uk/open-access-and-research-assessment/) about it
