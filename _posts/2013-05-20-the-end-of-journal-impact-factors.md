Last week it was great to see the publication of the [San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA)](http://am.ascb.org/dora/), which sets some important principles for the assessment of research. Advising on whether the [Higher Education Funding Council for England](http://www.hefce.ac.uk/) should sign the declaration was one of my first tasks in my role there and I am really pleased that we are a founding signatory. Central to the declaration is the notion that journal impact factors should not be used as proxies for the assessment of the quality of research outputs. Quite right &#8211; this [excellent post](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/) by [Stephen Curry](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/about/) explains why.

In the major research assessment that we run, the [Research Excellence Framework (REF)](http://www.ref.ac.uk/), it is already clearly stated that journal impact factors will not be used (just search for &#8216;impact factor&#8217; in the assessment panel [working methods](http://www.ref.ac.uk/media/ref/content/pub/panelcriteriaandworkingmethods/01_12.pdf) [pdf]). But clearly there is still a problem. The point is [repeatedly](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/02/08/impact-factors-and-an-alternative-to-ref-2014/) [made](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/political-science/2013/may/17/science-policy) that universities are using journal impact factors in their internal decision-making and staff management processes relating to the REF.

Why is it that the use of impact factors persists in the face of clear policy guidance that they don&#8217;t form part of the assessment? Being able to answer this is central to tackling the problem. I can think of two possible explanations:

  * <span style="line-height: 16px;">Despite the clarity of the panel working methods, there is a belief that panels will, in fact, use impact factors in their assessment of research outputs.</span>
  * Within Universities, senior staff and managers feel that they lack the time or the expertise to come to a judgement on the quality of research outputs, so reach for the easy proxy of journal impact factor.

<span style="font-size: medium;">Maybe there are other explanations that I am missing. Either way I would be interested in hearing what people think. Why do journal impact factors continue to be used inappropriately? All thoughts in the comments thread would be most welcome.</span>
