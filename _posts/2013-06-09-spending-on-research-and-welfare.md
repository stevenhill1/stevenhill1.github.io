Last week George Osborne sent a <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/george-osborne-gives-strong-hint-on-protecting-science/2004629.article" target="_self" title="">positive signal</a> about the likely outcome for research spending in the upcoming Spending Review, confirming that it is a 'personal priority'. This is welcome news. But he <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22801222" target="_self" title="">also said</a> something else:

> &#8220;We are making difficult decisions on things like welfare so that we can invest in areas like science.&#8221;

As someone who spends a lot of time advocating for maintenance or even increases in the research budget this statement made me feel very uncomfortable. If I thought that there was a direct trade-off between research and welfare spending I would not be supporting maintained research spending.

Of course, there isn't a direct trade-off, as reflected by the use of the word 'like' in the quote above, but it does serve as a timely reminder that any discussion about spending is deeply political. Where the money goes cannot be separated from where is comes from. I would much rather the 'difficult' decisions were about increasing taxes or cutting defence spending, rather than focussed on welfare.
