  1. <span style="color:#888888;">Communicate about the process of science as well as the content [</span>[<span style="color:#888888;">previous post</span>](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-step-1/)<span style="color:#888888;">]</span>
  2. <span style="color:#888888;">Make research outputs available to all for free [</span>[<span style="color:#888888;">previous post</span>](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/02/18/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-%e2%80%93-step-2/)<span style="color:#888888;">]</span>
  3. <span style="color:#888888;">Publish negative results and unsuccessful experiments too [</span>[<span style="color:#888888;">previous post</span>](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-%e2%80%93-step-3/)<span style="color:#888888;">]</span>
  4. <span style="color:#888888;">Publish peer review comments with research outputs. [</span>[<span style="color:#888888;">previous post</span>](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-%e2%80%93-step-4/)<span style="color:#888888;">]</span>
  5. <span style="color:#888888;">Attach a summary for non-experts to research outputs. [</span>[<span style="color:#888888;">previous post</span>](http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2010/03/12/7-steps-to-restore-trust-in-science-%e2%80%93-step-5/)<span style="color:#888888;">]</span>
  6. **Make raw data available as early as possible.** An essential feature of the scientific approach is repeating others&#8217; work, either strengthening or calling into question their findings. To make this possible, all scientific reports are accompanied by detailed descriptions of the experimental methods used. But it has not been normal practice for researchers to make their raw data available. As science becomes more and more data rich this has to change. As well as a focus on how data has been generated, we also need to scrutinise the analysis of large and complex datasets. Re-analysis of data can reveal errors, confirm original findings and strengthen confidence, as a <a href="http://www.jgc.org/blog/2010/02/rank-amateur.html" target="_blank">recent example</a> illustrates. And the internet makes sharing data simple and almost cost free.
