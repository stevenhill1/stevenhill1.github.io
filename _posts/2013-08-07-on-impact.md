Innovation is a complex business, but [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/) has some thought-provoking words in his [post](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2013/08/oh-thats-just-a-hack-someone-put-together.html) today:

> Inventing isn&#8217;t the hard part. The ideas that change the world are changing the world because someone cared enough to stick it out, to cajole and lead and evolve.

It seems to me he has captured something important there about impact, and what needs to be done to achieve it.
